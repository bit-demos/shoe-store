# Shoe Store App

The Shoe store is built as an app using the app aspect of Bit. The app is made up of components from the base-ui scope and the e-commerce scope.

Github: [shoe store repo](https://github.com/bit-demos/shoe-store)

## The shoe-store scope contains the following

### apps

This is the main app aspect. The `app.tsx` file contains the main application logic including the `<Head>` tags and the Router. It is in this file that you would add fonts to your head tag as well as configure meta tags. You can also use your Theme component here to wrap everything in the theme provider.

## Entity

An array of mock data to show some products according to the data structure. This data structure extends the e-commerce entity and adds the extra types of available colors and shoe size to the data structure.

## UI Components

UI components that could be used to create a store's UI. These include but are not limited to:

- A pages folder with pages for the home page and about page. These page components are then used inside the main app.
- A shoes folder which contains all domain components specific to shoes. By creating a custom product card component we have the flexibility of making this component different to the basic e-commerce component and add extra functionality etc. This gives us complete ownership over the component. However the components here are still made up from the smaller components of the base-ui scope as well as some of the components from the e-commerce scope.
