# E-commerce Components

This scope contains a collection of components that could be used to create e-commerce sites or applications. The objective is that any new store could easily be built using these components. This allows you to scale faster as you can build a new store without having to re-invent the wheel and in the future when you want to add new features to your store, you can simply remove these components and use your own product components for example. The idea of this scope is to give you a starting place when creating ecommerce stores and a consistent structure across stores.

## Content

Contains markdown components that could be used to create a store's content especially for pages that might be re-used across stores such as private pages, about pages, etc.

## Entity

An array of mock data to show some products according to the data structure. This data structure can be used by all stores to ensure the correct data is being passed and can also be extended incase new types need to be added.

## UI Components

UI components that could be used to create a store's UI. These include but are not limited to:

- A header and footer component so all stores have consistency.
- A logo component that could be used to display a store's logo.
- A pages folder with page templates for the home page and about page (if needed). This allows white label brands with the same design to be built very quickly and easily.
- Product components that include components specific to the product such as a product card, price, available colors, etc.
- A store hero component to show at the top of the store page.
