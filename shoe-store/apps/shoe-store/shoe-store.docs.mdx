## Application Component

Application component for the shoe store

Uses base components from the Base-ui scope and e-commerce components from the ecommerce scope. Extends the entity component to add size prop and uses it's own shoe-card instead of default prodcut-card. The shoe card can be modified furter to create a completely different look and feel from the other e-commerce product cards.

To run the application use:

```bash
bit run shoe-store
```
